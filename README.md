# FlairAssistant

FlairAssistant is a Devvit app that allows moderators to configure predefined actions that are executed when they set a specific flair on a post. This can be used to leave removal reasons, ban the author, or perform one of many other actions.

## 0.3.1

This update may fix some odd behavior with the order of actions.

### 0.3.0

This update added multiple new possible actions that flairs can trigger:

- [`clearUserFlair`](https://www.reddit.com/r/PitchforkAssistant/wiki/flairassistant#wiki_clearuserflair) - Clears the user flair of the post's author. This was possible before by setting the `userFlair` field to an empty object, but now it has its own field for clarity.
- [`postFlair`](https://www.reddit.com/r/PitchforkAssistant/wiki/flairassistant#wiki_userflair) - Changes the post's flair.
- [`removalReason`](https://www.reddit.com/r/PitchforkAssistant/wiki/flairassistant#wiki_removalreason) - Applies a native Reddit removal reason to the post.
- [`userNote`](https://www.reddit.com/r/PitchforkAssistant/wiki/flairassistant#wiki_usernote) - Adds a user note to the author of the post.
- [`message`](https://www.reddit.com/r/PitchforkAssistant/wiki/flairassistant#wiki_message) - Sends a message to the post's author or the subreddit.
